11. can u please write logic in shell or ansible if another server pinging fine we can transfer file source server to another server 
and if server not ping we cant transfer
step1: ping destination server ip from source server
step2:ssh Set up SSH key authentication
copy /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub in source server
paste /root/.ssh/authorized_keys in destination server
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
DEST_SERVER="172.31.86.20"
SOURCE_FILE="/path/to/source/file.txt"
DEST_PATH="/path/to/destination/directory/"

echo "Pinging destination server $DEST_SERVER..."
ping -c 2 $DEST_SERVER > /dev/null 2>&1

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Server $DEST_SERVER is reachable. Transferring file..."
    
    scp $SOURCE_FILE $DEST_SERVER:$DEST_PATH
    
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "File transfer successful."
    else
        echo "File transfer failed during SCP."
    fi
else
    echo "Server $DEST_SERVER is NOT reachable. File transfer skipped."
fi
